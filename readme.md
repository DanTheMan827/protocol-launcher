# Protocol Launcher
This is a very simple tool meant to be used with Steam or any other game management application that doesn't allow shortcuts to URLs.

## Usage
Usage is simple, add Protocol_Launcher.exe to your steam library and go into the properties for the shortcut.

Under launch options, specify your URL (e.g. forzamotorsportapex://)

When you launch the shortcut a window will appear and then your application will launch.  When finished, simply close the window that was opened.
